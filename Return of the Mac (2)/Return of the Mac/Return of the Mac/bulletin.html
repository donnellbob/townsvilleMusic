<h2>Chord Organ</h2>
<h3>Volunteer Singers / Musicians </h3>
<p>Our Parish Priest, Fr Mick Peters, is  trying to development and foster a community for our 6 PM Vigil Mass at <a href="http://www.sjnwtsv.catholic.edu.au/" target="new">St  Josephs on the Strand</a>. <br>
  I'm helping by organising an event  format, where I invite our members to bring a plate for a buffet and I provide  music, or friends who can sing or perform. <br>
  Now that we are achieving some success,  we need more people who can sing or play music. <br>
  I'm open to any kind of singing or  performing so long as it is not too controversial. My preference would be for  an artist to sing a medley of old time favorites. <br>
  Mass starts at 6pm and finishes about  10 to 7. </p>
<p>If you would like to take part, please  call Merle Trembath 0418882633 anytime </p>
