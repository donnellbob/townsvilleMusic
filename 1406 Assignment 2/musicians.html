<h2>Aquapella</h2>
<p>Aquapella are 50 singers from the  Townsville area bringing you a cappella world music at its very best: inspiring  and uplifting harmonies from around the globe. A South African party song, a  Hungarian love triangle, &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; in French - a  sumptuous variety of different languages, stories, rhythms and moods to  entertain and move you in the wonderful common language of music. Come along  and travel the world by song!</p>
<p>Choir director Beat Lehmann was born in  Switzerland where he first became involved in choir music by participating in  classical productions like Handel's Messiah, Mozart's Mass in C minor etc. A  study year abroad gave him the opportunity to sing with the Pontardullais Welsh  Male Choir. After completing an M.A. in Social Anthropology he concentrated on  his other passion, dance, directing a Modern Dance Company for several years.  In 1986, Beat migrated to Australia where he completed a Ph.D. in Linguistics  and involved himself in choir music again. For 12 years he conducted AkaBella,  a well-known world music choir from Bellingen, NSW. AkaBella participated in  major festivals like the National Folk Festival in Canberra, the Bellingen  Global Carnival and theWoodford Folk Festival where they featured in the ABC  documentary &quot;Festival on Fire&quot; and launched their first CD 'Mosaic'. Beat  moved to Magnetic Island in 2003 and has established a similarly successful  world music choir for the Townsville area. Beat's choirs focus on the rich  musical heritage of cultures around the globe. A South African party song, a  Hungarian love triangle, a Mexican lullaby, a French version of 'The Lion  Sleeps Tonight' to delve into the incredible variety and depth of a cappella  world music and the cultures it represents, is not only fun, but a very  enriching and uplifting experience.</p>
<p>Aquapella won the ABC Choir of the Year  competition for Queensland in 2006.<br>

<h2>The Camerata Singers</h2>
<h3>Poms from Oz</h3>
<p>The concept of the Camerata Singers  originated in the 1980s when Susan Grinsell, who was teaching voice at James  Cook University realised that ensemble singing was sadly lacking for tertiary  music students. Since then, Susan, along with repetiteur Carol Dalla Osto, has  strived to bring quality ensemble singing to the wider community by performing  at events from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aifestival" target="new">Ingham Italian Festival</a> through to Cottera's Markets in the  mall. </p>
<p>The Camerata Singers comprises a group  of trained singers, both male and female, from age 18 and over who strive to  provide quality performances in a range of styles from classical through to A  cappella and contemporary. A number of members also regularly participate in  local music theatre and theatre productions. For further information or  bookings contact the Music Centre 4724 2086<br>

<p>The Stokes Nicholson Big Band was  formed in 1991 through collaboration between the late Roy Stokes and Les  Nicholson. Each man had his own individual reasons for wanting a Big Band,  perhaps influenced by the difference in their ages with Roy being 17 years  older than Les. Roy wanted to create an opportunity to keep experienced  musicians playing challenging music so their talents didn't go rusty. Les came  from a different perspective and wanted to provide an opportunity for music  students of all ages to sit beside experienced jazz musicians to absorb the  musical synergy that classroom teaching alone cannot develop. </p>
<p>A number of experienced musicians were  invited to join the various sections of the new Big Band with most sections  being led by a member of Les' already well-established Pacific Mainstream Jazz  Band. The original Principals were Roy Stokes (not a member of PMJB),  saxophone; Les Nicholson, trumpet; Neville Minon, trombone; and Bob Hebden,  rhythm. Roy, Neville and Peter Alloway were all still private music teachers at  this time and some of their pupils were the first students to be part of this  adventure.</p>
<p>The Stokes Nicholson Big Band was up  and running, meeting once a month for rehearsals with an expectation that each  section would practise individually or as a group in between these rehearsals.</p>
<p>Sadly Roy passed away on 1st January  1993 after a period of illness. Les continued to manage the band and conduct  rehearsals, as well as playing first trumpet. In 1997 he enlisted the help of  John Ruffle who took on the role of Musical Director, allowing Les to relax a  little and enjoy his playing more. Roy would no doubt be very proud to see how  much his beloved Big Band has developed since its formation as it is now a very  accomplished band with a diverse repertoire and the technical expertise capable  of backing great Jazz singers.</p>
<p>The band today demonstrates it has  achieved the aims of both Roy and Les with experienced musicians arriving in  town and feeling very proud to join such a powerful big band. A number of the  original student members from 1991 are still in the band and have now joined  the ranks of the experienced musicians and new students are still progressing  from school bands to the Stokes Nicholson Big Band.</p>
