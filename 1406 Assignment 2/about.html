<h2><strong>A Brief History</strong><br>
</h2>
<p>by Jean Dartnall</p>
<p>1983             The Townsville Community Music  Centre was established at a public meeting on May 24th. Then Deputy Mayor, Ken  McElligott, opened the meeting and presented a cheque for $50 from the City  Council to cover initial petty cash, the Centre's first funds. At the meeting  an executive committee was formed. Over the next few weeks that committee  drafted a constitution which was endorsed at another public meeting on June  15th. Fred Thompson was Chairman from September 1983, with Gordon Dean as his  Deputy and Jan Eagleton as Secretary.</p>
<p><br>
  1984    -       Mira Henderson, who had extensive  experience in community music work in England, was the first staff member. (Her  position was Acting Director because she was only in Townsville for a brief  spell.) She instigated a series of classes starting in 1984 using the skills of  people living in Townsville to enhance and encourage music learners of all  ages.<br>
    <br>
1985    -      Kirsty Veron was appointed as the first  Director. Kirsty was very interested in teaching music to children and had  worked with Mira in the 1983 classes. She held this position until 1988 leading  the new organisation into a strong position in the Townsville arts community. The Music Centre produced Benjamin  Britten's Noyes Fludde in St James Anglican Cathedral. This involved hundreds  of children and some of Townsville's best known (and loved) musicians. It was  produced by Rachel Berker (now Rachel Matthews) and involved Bernie Lannigan  and Sandra Voss in the main parts rehearsed by Bill Williams; Donna McMahon and  Jenny Carr rehearsing the strings and recorders and guest conductor Donald  Hollier. This was by the no means the only major production mounted by the  Music Centre but was probably the largest.</p>
<p><br>
1987    -       This was the year of the first fund  raising dinner. These dinners became a tradition as they were a wonderful  mixture of good food, good wine and good music. The first ones were held at the  home of Paul and June Tonnoir in North Ward. Later they moved to the Bishop's  Lodge as guests of the Anglican Bishop. Attendees would often book their  tickets for the next year's dinner as soon as they had attended this one. They  ran until 2004.</p>
<p><br>
1988    -       Mary Lou Schoenfeldt was appointed as  Administrator. Although this was initially a small part time job with limited  responsibilities, Mary Lou made the job, the Centre and indeed music in  Townsville, her own. She was a wonderful asset to the Centre and to the  cultural life of the City until she had to retire due to ill health in 2003.</p>
<p><br>
1990    -       This year the first lunchtime concert was  held at the PercTucker Gallery. The importance of providing performance  opportunities for emerging musicians had become evident and from this time, for  a number of years, one of the major activities of the Centre was the production  and management of concerts.</p>
<p><br>
1999    -       Arts Queensland had been a major funder  of Music Centre activities for a number of years but in this year they agree to  provide funding on a three year basis. This made it much easier for the Centre  to plan ahead and reduced the time that had to be spent on repetitive grant  applications. This arrangement ran until 2004.</p>
<p><br>
2003    -       A spectacular variety concert was held at  the Townsville Civic Theatre to celebrate twenty years of the Music Centre and  as a tribute to May Lou.</p>
<p><br>
  2005    -       The Centre moved to offices in the Old  Magistrate's Court.<br>

  2012    -       The Centre moved to its present office in  the Townsville Civic Theatre building.</p>
